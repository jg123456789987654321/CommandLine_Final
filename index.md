# Analysis of Change Surrounding Business Improvement Districts in Philadelphia

## Business Improvement Districts Overview

Business Improvement Districts, or BIDs, are a publicly sanctioned private entities formed to fund and oversee the provision of supplemental services, typically along commercial corridors. They are formed through a vote, requiring a simple majority of property owners to be in favor of BID formation. Once formed these entities raise funds by charging members (property owners) an assessment fee, typically based on property value, but sometimes based on property size, size of sale transactions, or a combination of these factors. This money is then used to fund a variety of services including, street cleaning, private security forces, programing, facade improvements, administration, and other items. This model has gained increasingly popularity in the past decades as overall provision of services declined due to budget shortfalls in a number of American Cities. As cities across the country cut back on services like street sweeping and trash collection, property owners with the means to financially contribute have sought to take the provision of services under their own control through the creation of BIDs. However, the quasi-privatization of these services has come with a fair amount of discourse. The formation of BIDs can result in an improved public realm and the provision of fun interesting community events that would not exist without private intervention. It can also result in the commercialization of the limited public spaces in American Cities - with the founding ethos of many of these BIDs based on creating improved spaces to draw in paying customers from elsewhere, not to make neighborhoods nicer for existing residents. Additionally, the governing structure of BIDs is incredibly opaque and is often accompanied by a complete lack of oversight. Some of the largest BIDs in the county oversee budgets as large as $30 million, but the public has little input into how this money is spent. There are also concerns regarding the proliferation of private security forces accompanying these BIDs, which some say leads to further criminalization of people deemed as undesirable by commercial entities, including unhoused people. Finally, some scholars link the creation of BIDs to the gentrification of areas (PULL a quote of two), seeing their formation as the beginning of changes in an area that will lead to changes in property values, business types, and demographics of neighborhoods. In broad, sweeping strokes, those in favor of BIDs see it as a viable way to improve commercial corridors that may have gone without these services otherwise, those opposed see it as a further neo liberalization of public services that enables business and property owners to convert the public realm into network of small fiefdoms in which the presence of consumers is exalted and anyone else is made to feel unwelcome.     


## Application in Philadelphia
Various neighborhoods in Philadelphia have long pursued BIDs as a strategy to improve commercial corridors. The first BID in Philadelphia, the Center City District, was formed in 1991, by the Central Philadelphia Development Corporation (a 501c3 organization, not a CDC). Since then, 17 other BID and SSDs have been formed, with roughly half of them being formed before the turn of the century. This model has been especially prevalent in Philadelphia, due to the city's continued budget difficulties and failure to provide adequate public services. Below is a map of the City's Business Improvement and Special Services Districts (SSDs) and the authorization dates, SSD with special uses (Sports Arena) and industrially focused SSDs were not included.

### BIDs and Neighborhood Change
Some of the more recently created BIDs in Philadelphia have formed in areas that have been associated with rapid gentrification. To try and determine what, if any, impact these institutions have had on gentrification in these areas we will examine a collection of change indicators including: Median Household Income (MHHI), Median Rent, Percent Non-Hispanic White Residents, New Residential or Commercial Development, and New Business Formation. To try and parse out the impact that formation has, and try and understand the preconditions for formation, only BIDs that were formed between 2012 and 2022 were selected. This enables us to look at the data mentioned above for a few years before and after formation. Unfortunately, this means only four BIDs were selected, the Mayfair Business Improvement District (Est. 2015), the Northern Liberties BID (Est.2018), the Fishtown BID (Est.2019), and the North Broad Improvement District (Est.2022). These districts are highlighted in blue in the image above. A description of the data sources and the relevant data cleaning use in this analysis are below:

**Median Household Income (MHHI), Median Rent, and % Non-Hispanic White Residents:** 
Data pulled from the American Community Survey 5 year estimates for the years 2010-2022 at the census tract level. Getting data at this granular of a level resulted in some higher CV's, data with CV's over 40 are indicated by crosshatching across the relevant census tract. 

**New Residential or Commercial Development:** 
Data pulled from the Open Philly Licenses and Inspections - Building and Zoning Permits dataset for the years 2007-mid year 2024. This is an incredibly dense dataset that includes permits for home repairs, lot line relocations, and fire safety inspections. To remove these spurious observations, permit data was filtered by the 'Type of Work' column to specify for new construction. The data was further filtered by the 'Permit Description' column to subset for commercial or residential new construction. The codes related to new construction in both columns have significantly changed over the years. A histogram of each variable by year was used to determine which codes were employed over time, in order to avoid subsetting by a code that was only used for portion of the duration of the relevant time period. The dataset was clipped to a quarter mile buffer of the BIDs, which will help estimate neighborhood impact. A new variable that indicated years before or after BID formation was created to temporally normalize all data and improve comparison across different BIDs. 

**New Business Formation:** 
Data pulled from the Open Philly Licenses and Inspections Business Licenses Dataset. Data for all businesses formed is not available, this dataset only includes permits for businesses activity required to have a license like rental properties, restaurants, vendors, etc. However, these types of businesses are often associated with gentrification and still help us understand the changing nature of a neighborhood. The dataset was further subset to exclude licenses for things such as dumpsters, towing permits, or scales and scanner permits, which are not indicative of new businesses forming. The Initial Formation Date column was used to determine business formation date. Additionally, the distance between business location, given in the xy coordinates of each observation, and owner location, written as text was used to determine change in localized ownership rates. The get the distance between the two locations in miles, the centroid from the ZIP code given in the owner address was taken and distance was calculated between the centroid and the business location. Locations within the same zip code were counted as 0, as this represents localized ownership. This data was clipped to the BID boundaries and not the BID buffer boundaries to focus on the impact of businesses within the district. A new variable that indicated years before or after BID formation was created to temporally normalize all data and improve comparison across different BIDs.

### A Decade of Change
The maps below examine Median Rent, Median Household Income, and Percent of White Non-Hispanic Residents by the Census Tract in 2012 and in 2022. There has been tremendous change in Philadelphia in the past decade and to compare the simple numeric values of each of these measure in both time periods would not help us understand which neighborhoods experienced the most amount of change. To understand the relative change compared to different areas within the city, a ratio of the census tract value to the average of each variable (rent, income, and % white) across census tracts was created. A ratio below 1 indicates that the census tract has a value less than the city average, a ratio of 1 indicates the census tract is in line with the city average, and a ratio above 1 means the census tract has a value above the city average. For example, this ratio can help identify a census tract that had below average incomes in 2012, but above average incomes in 2022. Areas that jumped from ratios below 1 in 2012 to ratios above 1 in 2022 have experienced change at a faster rate than the city average.

There does appear to be a modest relationship between BID presence and change in levels of Income and the share of White residents in census tracts, especally in the Fishtown, Kensington, and North Broad BIDs. However, we cannot determine if this relationship is causal without additional investigation. 

### New Construction Permits and New Business Licenses Relative to BID Formation
To futher understand the relationship between BIDs and neighborhood change, we can examine the rates of new construction and new business formation in the area around a BID both before and after formation. 
Below is a map illustrating the number of new construction permits and new business licenses in the areas surrounding BIDS. As previously mentioned, the timeline of these permits and licenses is relative to BID formation in the area.
